# Wireframes Instructions
- create a visual wireframe for a web application
- use mantine components from mantine.dev to build the UI
- ensure the prototype is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Only add components and features that are mentioned. do not add any extra components,sections or features.
- build the wireframe as html,css,js so I can just open it in a browser without any build steps
- use "ui_references/vibe.png" as a reference for the overall wireframe style and structure.
- all the navigation items should be added on the sidebar if it exists in the reference image and if it is specified from the prompt. By default, there should be no item in this navigation items except the logo at the top unless specified otherwise.

-for any image placeholder like avatar,  use any safe available avatar generator or image generator online.
- for application logo use a spade emoji.
- save it inside "./wireframe-prototype/*" folder.
